\chapter{Preface}

All of the work presented henceforth was conducted in the NSS 
(Networks, Systems and Security) lab in the Department of Computer
Science at the University of British Columbia, Point Grey campus.

The work presented in this thesis is original, unpublished work by 
the author, Clement Fung. This work was performed in
collaboration with Syed Iqbal, Jamie Koerner and Stewart Grant. The
entirety of this work was designed and written in assistance with Dr. Ivan
Beschastnikh, who supervised this projects and all the students
involved.

The design of the TorMentor algorithms, system and API in 
Chapter~\ref{sec:design} were performed by the author. Jamie
implemented and designed the differentially-private learning component
described in Section~\ref{sec:training} and 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:training}. Syed assisted me with the implementation
of the go-python component of the system described in Chapter~
\ref{sec:impl}. Jamie implemented the noise function in Python
described in Chapter~\ref{sec:impl}.

Regarding the evaluation of the system, Jamie executed the experiments
for and generated Figure~\ref{fig:bs50}. Stewart assisted with the
deployment of the system on Azure described in Chapter~\ref{sec:impl}
and used to generate Figures \ref{fig:withtor}, \ref{fig:without},
\ref{fig:poison} and \ref{fig:thresholds}. All other figures and
experiments were designed and conducted by the author.
