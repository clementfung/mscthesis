\chapter{Acknowledgments}

This research was funded by grants from both the Natural Science and
Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant, Huawei
Technologies Co., and the Institute for Computing, Information and
Cognitive Systems (ICICS) at the University of British Columbia, Point
Grey Campus.

Thank you to Ivan Beschastnikh for taking a chance on me as your
student and providing careful guidance throughout my Masters degree,
introducing me to the joys of research.

Thank you to the members of the NSS lab for joining me through the
perils of graduate school, most notably Amanda Carbonari, Fabian
Ruffy, Stewart Grant, Nodir Kodirov and Puneet Mehrotra. All of you
made my numerous late nights in the lab bearable, and to some extent,
even a little enjoyable.

In addition to those above, thank you to the many new friends I have
made here at UBC: Giovanni Viviani, Yasha Pushak, Neil Newman, Kuba
Karpierz, Siddhesh Khandelwal, Alistair Wick, Nico Ritschel, and many
more who deserve to be listed. You kept me sane at times when my
research was struggling, and kept my work-life balance in check.

Lastly, thank you to my friends and family in Toronto for supporting
me from a distance. Despite our physical distance, I have always felt
extremely grateful to have such a loving network of support available
to me.
