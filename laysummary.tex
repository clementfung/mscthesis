\chapter{Lay Summary}
Machine learning is a form of analysis that draws insights from large
volumes of training data. This mandates the collection of data into a
single system for analysis, but the nature of data today is highly
distributed and private. Furthermore, most of this analysis is
performed by companies, who lack incentive to provide user privacy.

We design TorMentor, a system that enables anonymous, distributed
machine learning between parties. Our contribution also includes a
novel learning paradigm called \textit{brokered learning}, which
removes the role of the central institution in the machine learning
process.

Through brokered learning, TorMentor protects the privacy and
security of data providers while ensuring that analysis is performed
correctly. We design and evaluate such a system and show that it
outperforms the state of the art in defending against known
privacy and security threats on distributed machine learning systems.
